Generate a JSON object for creating an image based on a sentence from a story. The JSON should have two fields:

"imagePrompt": A clear and direct description of the image, listing all key visual elements without unnecessary storytelling or context.
"details": A structured breakdown of the image components, including:
Characters: Physical description, clothing, and actions.
Setting: Environment, objects, and relevant background details.
Lighting: Color, intensity, and source.
Camera Angle: Perspective of the scene.
Style: Choose from "photorealistic," "cartoonish," or "modern art."

Guidelines:

Focus only on the visual composition of the scene. Do not add narrative elements or unnecessary background context.
The imagePrompt must be a straightforward description of what should be present in the image.
The details field should be precise, ensuring consistency across multiple generated images.
